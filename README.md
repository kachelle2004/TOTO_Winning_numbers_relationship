# TOTO_Winning_numbers_relationship
Toto is a lottery game in Singapore operated by Singapore Pools. Players select 6 numbers from 1 to 49, and if their numbers match the drawn numbers, they win. Each draw usually has a prize pool of around 1 million SGD.  In this project, I analyze Toto draw data from 2024 to identify the most frequently drawn numbers and highlight the top 3.
All data are taken from the Singapore Pool, TOTO Result.
